## Getting Started
1. Install Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Install Meteor - https://www.meteor.com/install

	**OSX / Linux**
	Run the following command in your terminal to install the latest official Meteor release:
	```
	> curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
	```
	For compatibility, Linux binaries are built with CentOS 6.4 i386/amd64.

	**Windows**
	First install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install), then run this command using an **Administrator command prompt**:
	```
	> choco install meteor
	```
	Meteor supports Windows 7/Windows Server 2008 R2 and up. The installer uses Chocolatey, which has its own requirements. Disabling antivirus (Windows Defender, etc.) will improve performance.

3. Download files or clone repository
4. Run project
	```
	> meteor npm install && meteor --settings settings.json
	```
5. Open your browser with the URL [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
6. You will see the registration page. Provide your e-mail from which you will be sending messages, and your password to protect your data. SendGrid API key is optional when you register, but you will need to add it (in settings)  before you will start sending e-mails. All data will be kept on your local machine, or if you upload it to your server, then they will be stored there.

## Sendgrid
This application is using the SendGrid SMTP server to send emails. All you need is to create an account on sendgrid.com, create an API key and paste it to the app.
SendGrid is a Denver, Colorado-based customer communication platform for transactional and marketing email. The company was founded by Isaac Saldana, Jose Lopez, and Tim Jenkins in 2009, and incubated through the Techstars accelerator program. Now is a part of the Twilio company.
**For statistics in .meteoremails panel, you need to have Essentials plan with "Additional Email Activity History" enabled**
Whithout that you can check for statistics direct in SendGrid panel

## Upload to server
If you do not want to use it on the local machine, you can upload it to your server. The tool that can help you with that is available here: http://meteor-up.com/. Meteor Up is a production-quality tool to setup servers and deploy your Meteor apps to them
Install Meteor Up with one command:
```
> npm install --global mup
```
You should install mup on the computer you are deploying from. Mup requires node 8 or newer.
You need at least one server to deploy to. Many companies offer them for $5 / month or less, including Digital Ocean, Vultr, and Hetzner.
The server should:
Have at least 512MB of ram. 1GB is recommended.
Be running Ubuntu 14 or newer.
You do not need to install anything on your servers; mup will set them up for you.
